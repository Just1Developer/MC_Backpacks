# MC_Backpacks
Backpacks for spigot 1.20; One of my own little projects

A plugin that adds craftable Backpacks to Minecraft. The backpacks are craftet similarly to shulker boxes, there are normal Backpacks and Ender-Backpacks (they just open your Ender Chest on the go).
The items for Backpacks and Ender-Backpacks can be set in the config, as well as enable / disable them entirely.

There is also an option to disable putting backpacks inside other backpacks. If disabled, players will still be able to retrieve stored backpacks from inside backpacks, but it will no longer be possible to put backpacks inside.

Note that backpacks can now be stacked without an issue. This is a warning from the Alpha.

The images were made using a texture pack that uses textures from a backpack mod. Since I don't know if I can publish these textures / my texture pack because it uses them, I'm not going to. Feel free to make your own!
I might add a texture pack for these backpacks in the future, though.
