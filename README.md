# Minecraft Backpacks for Spigot Vanilla
Backpacks for Spigot 1.20 and other versions. This is one of my own little projects.

A plugin that adds craftable Backpacks to Minecraft. The backpacks are craftet similarly to shulker boxes, there are normal Backpacks and Ender-Backpacks (they just open your Ender Chest on the go).
The items for Backpacks and Ender-Backpacks can be set in the config, as well as enable / disable them entirely.

There is also an option to disable putting backpacks inside other backpacks. If disabled, players will still be able to retrieve stored backpacks from inside backpacks, but it will no longer be possible to put backpacks inside.

# Resource pack

Since the 2.0, the used resource pack now comes with the plugin!
You can enable / disable resource pack usage in the config, usage is *enabled* by default. Disabling is useful if you wish to provide your own resource pack.
